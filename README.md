# Image Seam Slicer

This project enhances a previous image compression program by adding the ability to remove vertical seams from PNG images. A vertical seam is a path of pixels from the top to the bottom of the image, where each pixel is directly or diagonally below the previous one. The program can remove either the bluest vertical seam (highest sum of blue values) or the vertical seam with the lowest energy (least impact on image recognizability). The user interface allows users to highlight and confirm seam removal, with an option to undo recent deletions, providing an efficient tool for intelligent image compression.
